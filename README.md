# data_struct
a few of the data structures that i studied, and functions that i added to manipulate the structures and find data. Some of them, the professor of the subject in university, built the struct and gave it for us to create and manipulate the functions, and others like the b-three, i built with the help of some pseudo-code and other github repository.
